To run proxy server 
./webproxy <PORT Number> <Cache timeout>

./webproxy 10001 100


Testing Instructions 
Clear the Mozilla cache and local proxy server cache 


For Testing with http browser (Mozilla Firefox)
1)http://www.umich.edu/~chemh215/W09HTML/SSG4/ssg6/html/Website/DREAMWEAVERPGS/first.html
2)www.google.com 

For Testing with telnet
telnet 127.0.0.1 10001
GET http://www.google.com HTTP/1.0


Implemntation of Code


1) Proxy Implementation - 

 The webproxy parses the request from client.
 Checks if present in cache
 If exists displays

       CACHE MEMORY FOUND and popilates information from caache to client
 else

       displays NO CACHE FOUND and passes the appropriate request to server

 Sends the requested information back to client and parallely stores it on cache memory



2) Caching and Timeout implementation 

For caching and searching file , MD5 hashing is been used


current time + file modified time  < timeout - file is fetched from cache 

else
	File fetched from Proxy Server (and replaces the old file if present)


3) Prefetching Implementation 

The links present in the file from server are extracted and passed onto server

server responds appropriately with the request and is stored in the cache 



4) PORT implementation 

The URL is always checked for a port number and if not found default hit on port 80 both from browser and telnet
